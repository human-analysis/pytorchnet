# Welcome to *PyTorchNet*!

****PyTorchNet**** is a Machine Learning framework that is built on top of [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch). And, it uses Tensorboard (or Visdom) for visualization.

PyTorchNet is easy to be customized by creating the necessary classes:
 1. **Data Loading**: a dataset class is required to load the data.
 2. **Model Design**: a nn.Module class that represents the network model.
 3. **Loss Method**: an appropriate class for the loss, for example CrossEntropyLoss or MSELoss.
 4. **Evaluation Metric**: a class to measure the accuracy of the results.

# Structure
PyTorchNet consists of HAL library which has the following packages:
## HAL/Datasets

This is for loading and transforming datasets.
## HAL/Models

Network models are kept in this package. It already includes [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385), [PreActResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.05027), [Stacked Hourglass](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.06937) and [SphereFace](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.08063).
## HAL/Losses

There are number of different choices available for Classification or Regression. New loss methods can be put here.
## HAL/Metrics

There are number of different choices available for Classification or Regression. New accuracy metrics can be put here.

## Root

 - main
 - model

# Setup
First, you need to download PyTorchNet by calling the following command:
> git clone https://github.com/human-analysis/pytorchnet.git

PyTorchNet relies on several Python packages, such as Pytorch, Pytorch Lightning, tensorboard, Pillow Image, etc. you need to make sure that the requirements exist.



**Notice**

* If you do not have Pytorch or it does not meet the requirements, please follow the instruction on [the Pytorch website](http://pytorch.org/#pip-install-pytorch).

Congratulations!!! You are now ready to use PyTorchNet!

# Usage

PyTorchNet comes with a classification example in which a [ResNet](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) model is trained for the [CIFAR10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) dataset.

> python [main.py](https://github.com/human-analysis/pytorchnet/blob/dev/main.py)

# Configuration

PyTorchNet loads its parameters at the beginning via a config file and/or the command line.
## Config file
When PyTorchNet is being run, it will automatically load all parameters from [args.txt](https://github.com/human-analysis/pytorchnet/blob/master/args.txt) by default, if it exists. In order to load a custom config file, the following parameter can be used:
> python main.py --config custom_args.txt
### args.txt
> [Arguments]
> save_results = No\
> \
> #project options\
> project_name=CIFAR10\
> save_dir=results/\
> logs_dir=results/\
> \
> #dataset options\
> dataset=CIFAR10\
> dataroot=data/\
> cache_size=1000\
> \
> #model options\
> precision=32\
> batch_size_test = 128\
> batch_size_train = 128\
> model_type = MobileNetV2\
> loss_type = Classification\
> evaluation_type = Accuracy\
> \
> resolution_high = 32\
> resolution_wide = 32\
> \
> manual_seed = 0\
> nepochs = 200\
> \
> optim_method = SGD\
> learning_rate = 0.1\
> optim_options = {"momentum": 0.9, "weight_decay": 5e-4}\
> \
> scheduler_method = CosineAnnealingLR\
> scheduler_options = {"T_max": 200}\
> \
> #cpu/gpu settings\
> ngpu = 1\
> nthreads = 4



## Command line
Parameters can also be set in the command line when invoking [main.py](https://github.com/human-analysis/pytorchnet/blob/master/main.py). These parameters will precede the existing parameters in the configuration file.
